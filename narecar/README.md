<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


in this project, I have focused my knowledge in creating an application related to the purchase and sale of cars, with a series of components created by myself, I decided to choose a theme of cars because of my fondness for them, on the main page you can see a header with a menu of 4 buttons that take you to a different page, then a description with a slogan of my company, as well as below an image with the brands we work with and finally a footer with 3 of my social networks.

In the other pages I have used an array of json objects to store cars, of which I have saved images, and the model, brand and price of each car.

It is a project to which I have dedicated hours and affection, since it is something that excites me to do for my fondness for cars, and I have done this more for the illusion of programming something that I like, than to approve this task.

Here you can see the design that I did by myself to let you see what was my inspiration to do the app on this way https://www.figma.com/file/O8xmN3BOQ8PIOf56BafE9t/Cochify?node-id=0%3A1&t=fUR4ubIJ6CylzSAN-1
